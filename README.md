## Introduction to ShuZip
### What is ShuZip?
ShuZip is an encrypted zip with passwords or just ShuHash Links.
### How do the ShuHash Links Protect ShuZip Privacy?
ShuHash is for **public** files. You can protect your privacy when creating a ShuZip file with a password. If you are creating one with ShuHash, then it is sensible for your privacy to add a password too.
### Does ShuZip support SHA-1, SHA-256 or other encryptions?
ShuZip has its own encryption root - ShuEncr. This ensures that no trackers can see that what you are doing in ShuZip.
### Does ShuZip have a file explorer?
No, but you can use our program to turn it into a normal *(.zip)* file.
